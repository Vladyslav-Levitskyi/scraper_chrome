# Automated Web Scraper with Chromedriver

This project is an automated web scraper based on Selenium with the `chromedriver.exe` driver. It consists of two main scripts: `searcher_se.py` for login automation and saving HTML page templates, and `scraper_bs.py` for local data parsing.

## Overview

1. **File `searcher_se.py`**:
   - Automates website login.
   - Navigates to the desired section of the site.
   - Saves HTML templates for a specified range of pages.
   - This reduces server load as the pages are downloaded locally.

2. **File `scraper_bs.py`**:
   - Parses the saved HTML templates on the local machine.
   - This method is effective for obtaining data from obfuscated or protected pages, as it doesnâ€™t generate many requests to the server.

This approach is particularly useful when data is protected or challenging to extract with standard HTTP requests.

## Project Components

### `searcher_se.py`
- **Purpose**: Automates login and navigation on the website.
- **Capabilities**:
  - Logs in using Selenium.
  - Can navigate to specific pages and download HTML templates for local storage.

### `scraper_bs.py`
- **Purpose**: Parses locally saved HTML templates using BeautifulSoup.
- **Output**: After parsing, data can be saved in a convenient format, such as JSON.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**
- **Selenium** and **BeautifulSoup**
- **Chromedriver**: Ensure that `chromedriver.exe` is either in the project directory or specified in your PATH.

## Installation

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   Download the appropriate version of chromedriver.exe for your browser and place it in the project directory or ensure it is in your PATH.

## Usage

Run searcher_se.py to automate site login and save HTML pages:

python searcher_se.py

This script will save HTML page templates for later parsing.

Run scraper_bs.py to parse saved HTML templates on your local machine:

python scraper_bs.py

## Benefits

Minimized server load: Storing HTML locally helps avoid excessive requests to the server.
Ideal for protected data: Saved HTML files simplify data extraction, even for obfuscated or protected content on the server.
